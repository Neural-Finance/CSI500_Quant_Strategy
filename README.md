# CSI500_Quant_Strategy

### Highlights
1. Only based on daily <open，high，low，close，volunme，amount> data
   
2. All parameters are based on grid search or the sub nerual network inferring/learning, quite automated

3. Selecting factors may easily cause unavoidable overfitting, we chose it because it perform well in the history. In my cases, all the factors are fixed before 2021-12, which means this factor will not influence 2021-12 to now
